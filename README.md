Data Science Team Project

Used Datasets:
1. All recorded crime in Bexar county.
Contains: Sex, Race, Offense Date, Offense Code, Offense Type.

2. Weather from stations in Bexar County, such as the San Antonio Airport.
Contains: Hourly, Temperature, Precipitation, Humidity, Pressure, Sky Quality.


Patterns we hope to discover:

Weather forecast allows us to be prepared for any hazardous weather. However, there are several studies that have correlated overcast, cold, or rainy weather with mood change. Furthermore, the impact that weather has on people can also be correlated to an increase or decrease in crime. Weather can unconsciously make people feel depressed or even make them feel they need to consume alcohol and drive, consume drugs, or have a reckless behavior that leads to crime. This project will analyze two data sets, one on weather in Bexar county and one in crimes committed in Bexar county. Using these two data sets we can find patterns and produce a correlation between crimes and depressive weather.
